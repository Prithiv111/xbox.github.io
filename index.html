                  <h2>Xbox</h2>
                  <p>The Xbox is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. It was first introduced on November 15, 2001, in North America, with the launch of the original Xbox console. Since then, Microsoft has released several consoles in the Xbox series, including Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
                  <p>The development of the Xbox was initiated by a small team within Microsoft, including Seamus Blackley, who proposed the idea of creating a gaming console using Microsoft's DirectX technology. The project, initially named "DirectX Box," eventually became the Xbox.</p>

                  <h2>PlayStation</h2>
                  <p>PlayStation is a gaming brand owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The first PlayStation console was launched on December 3, 1994, in Japan. Since then, Sony has released several iterations of the PlayStation, including PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>
                  <p>The development of the PlayStation was led by Ken Kutaragi, often referred to as the "Father of PlayStation."
